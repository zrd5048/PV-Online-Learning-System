## Description

**Description:** This project was made for the purpose of being a *demo* only. It was made to showcase the navigation of an Online Testing & Grading platform designed for Penns Valley Area School District. Some capablities of this *demo* website are as follows:

- Messaging System
  - Communication between students, teachers, and parents
- Testing
  - Enables students to take tests online, rather than paper & pencil tests. Less paper used and can be scored upon completion if the teacher chooses
- Grading
  - Staff can input grades online for students and their parents to view.
